Our tools shape our understanding and thinking. Developed language created greek logic. The exactitude of writing prompted scientific revolution.

There were no people who had logic in them, but just had no vehicle to express it. And writing is not just the means of expression of scientific ideas. It's more profound then that. People first started using new tools like language and writing. And only later their minds got filled with new ideas.

I wonder if the same dynamic works on the personal level. Take people who write books for example. Common sense tells us that they had lot's of ideas so they ended up writing. But maybe the flow is the other way around. They were enamored with writing, wrote a lot and end up having lots of ideas and some of their writing becomes books.

How can we support this claim? If we think of writing as a technology similar to programming it becomes kind of obvious. People excited with computer programs play with them a lot, have ideas and eventually create great software.

Why is it so obvious for programming and not for writing? Programming is new and not all people know it, so the direction from learning to practicing to creating something good is pretty obvious.

Writing, on the other hand, is ubiquitous. Different people have different writing ability. We tend to miss the practice component. We tend to look at the person more and miss the differences in usage of technology itself.

But there is another very interesting point here. Maybe the difference in person is there. The thing is, this difference is produced by his extensive usage of the tool (writing or programming).

This logic creates much more respect for the idea: "We shape our tools. And then our tools shape us." - Marshall McLuhan.
